			<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3> 
				<p>My interest in IT started when I was a young kid and first played the Super Nintendo. This instantly hooked me into playing video games and exploring on the family computer to see what I could do with it. One event that grew my interest in the hardware side of IT was when my dad and I pulled apart our old computer and I saw what it looked like inside the machine I had been using for years. My experience in IT contains bits and pieces from most parts of the IT world due to my previous role as a System/ Server admin that worked closely alongside the developers which helped me learn some of the basics in programming, as well as teaching myself on the hardware side of IT by building my own computers.</p>
			
			<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3> 
				<p>I chose to study at RMIT as I had been looking at a few online courses and this course at RMIT suited what I was looking for in content while also remaining well priced compared to some of the other online education companies.</p>

			<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
				<p>I am expecting to learn the most current and a wide variety of different parts of the IT world as I have spent the last few years in a singular role and havenâ€™t been able to keep up with other areas of the IT world. Plus learning new skills like Git, data collection & analysis and mobile technologies.</p>
