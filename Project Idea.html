					<h3>Overview (100 words) - This should be a summary of what the project will be. </h3>
						<p>The project I have chosen for this is designing an app/ website that allows users to rate parks for a variety of different categories. For example, rating parks on how well they are for running, suitable for dogs and relaxed events like picnics and group activities.</p>
					<h3>Motivation (100) words) - This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful. This may include statistics or other evidence, such as: "There service. are 1.5 billion cat owners in Australia, and so there is a huge market for an automated cat feeder. Using Raspberry Pi technology is a cheap and easily assembled solution to this problem." </h3>
						<p>This project would be useful for the community because after some google research, I have noticed there is a lack of apps in Australia that helps people who exercise (including myself), people with animals and people who use parks for social activities.</p>
						<p>The drawbacks that this app will face is that a lot of the key areas (reviews and information on the parks) will require a lot of user input.</p>
					<h3>Description (500 words) - Detailed description of the features of the product or service Tools. </h3>
						<p>The features of the app will focus on a variety of ways users will be able to rate, suggest and community work with parks. These include: 
							<ul>
								<li>A search feature that will be able to show users parks near them via searching by suburbs or using the map feature.</li>
								<li>A way to either leave a review of the park while also being able to click on one of the icons that are a quick and easy way to show other users what the park is best for. e.g. </li>
									<ul>
									<li>A dog on a lead to show that it is good for animals that will also show that this park allows animals</li>
									<li>A picnic bench that will show it good for social events like a picnic or BBQ</li>
									<li>A person running that will show that is good for people who would want to use the park for exercise</li></ul></ul>
					<h3>Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open-source tools as appropriate.</h3>
						<p>The software needed to create this app would be a platform that supports the use of google maps implementation and the ability to test the app on a multiple variety of devices. E.g. Smartphones for Apple and Android OS systems, a web browser for the web version of the platform and a storage platform for the user added data.</p>
					<h3>Skills Required (100 words) - List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required? </h3>
						<p>A large variety of skills will be required to make this application as it will involve development on smartphones and web browsers. These skills will be around software programming and design, as well as website html design. The hardware needed for this would be access to multiple smartphone operating systems for testing purposes.</p>
					<h3>Outcome (100 words) - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</h3>
						<p>For the project to be successful, it will need to allow users to access the app from wherever the user may be, allow them to provide reviews and search for parks via the map or list that is sorted via either distance or what you would be using the park for. The original problem will be solved as current map systems & apps donâ€™t provide more detailed information on parks and this can cause issues for pet owners and people who are looking to exercise in parks.</p>
