			<h3>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</h3>
				<p>The scrum master position is built into the company to help with the agile and quick release methodology of what is required in the company. It also allows this high energy and complex team to work the transparency that will help the team by being able to communicate effectively and have their scum master easily be able to communicate to the program managers on behalf of the scrum team.
				This position is appealing to me because I have worked in this position as a temporary and being able to assist others in getting the best work out of them is what I strive to do in this role. </p>
			<h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h3>
				<p>The skills required for this role would need be a wide variety as the scrum master would need to have a basic understanding of the jobs the team would be doing. For example, the programming languages they use, software systems etc. Other key skills that would be needed by the scrum master would be excellent communications skills via email, messaging & oral, assertiveness, proficiency is an online scrum management tool (Jira), have a strong commitment to delivery in timelines and finally being certified as a scrum master.</p>
			<h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h3> 
				<p>The skills that I have for this role is that I am already a certified scrum master, have a least 1.5 years of experience running scrums as a scrum master while also having 2 years working in an agile team. I also have strong communication skills from my previous time working as a scrum master as well as having a previous role that involved a lot of communication and handling meetings.</p>
			<h3>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway) but try to be as specific as you can.</h3>
				<p>The skills I would need to help me get this role would be gaining more years of experience in running scrums in my current position while also building in my skills to help assist others in the scrum and working as a servant manager instead of assisting as a leading manager.</p>
