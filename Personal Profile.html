			<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
				<p>These don’t mean much for me as it only shows a vague outline of the person because the answers, they give are very broad and don’t really apply to all events in a person’s day to day. Though it would assist to a degree on when working with team/ project members.</p>
			<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
				<p>I’m not sure these results would influence my behaviour in a team because I perform more on how the others in the team react around me and with the situations that occur during the team working together. </p>
			<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
				<p>I would use this data at the start of forming a team, somewhat like a base/ outline on the selection process before I start taking a deeper look into the applicants. The reason why I would use this as a base/outline is because these personality tests only show a small part of the applicant’s skill/ abilities. Also, a bit problem with these test is the fact that a person sees themselves differently from how others see them and will provide those answers to cover up flaws.</p>
